    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a 7×7-inch dark metal pan with melted butter and line with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven at 180℃.</li>
            <li>Take a little water in a saucepan and bring it to a simmer.</li>
            <li>In the meantime cut the chocolate into small pieces and place them in a heat resistant bowl. Place the bowl on top of the simmering water making sure that the bottom of the bowl isn’t touching the water.</li>
            <li>Add  butter to the bowl and whisk the chocolate and the butter together until it melts and becomes smooth, then take it off the heat and let it cool.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, in a separate bowl, put white and brown sugar.</li>
            <li>Add 1 egg at a time and mix properly using a hand whisk.</li>
            <li>When the mixture is a little creamy add the salt, the vanilla essence, and the cooled chocolate and butter mixture. Mix everything well. The batter will have a thicker consistency.</li>
            <li>Sift the flour and the cocoa powder into the bowl and carefully fold them into the mixture using a spatula.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the prepared baking pan then gently shake and tap the tin couple of times to spread the batter evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake it in preheated oven for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>When your brownie is baked take it out of the oven and let it cool for at least 15 minutes. Slice them into 9 squares and enjoy your warm fudgy brownies.</li>
